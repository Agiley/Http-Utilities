===== Http-Utilities =====

Http-Utilities is a wrapper for common HTTP-libraries (Net::Http, Open Uri, Curb) using a unified API.

I personally use this in quite a few projects and decided to extract it into a separate gem.

Features:
- Support for Net:Http, Open Uri, Curb
- Proxy support (adds a proxy model). Enables you to randomly use different proxies on every request.
- Proxy checker (comes with Resque jobs for scheduling)

There are some specs but the gems need more test/spec coverage.

This is primarily intended for private use, but get back to me if you use it and run into issues.
